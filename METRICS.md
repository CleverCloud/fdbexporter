## How to generate

1. Run `docker-compose.yml` with `docker compose up -d`
2. Ensure `curl localhost:9090` outputs Metrics
3. Download [`prom2json`](https://github.com/prometheus/prom2json) on your system
4. Ensure you got `jq` on your system
5. Execute jq request below
6. Rewrite the whole table with output data

```
./prom2json http://localhost:9090 | jq 'sort_by(.name) | .[] | @text"| `\(.name)` | \(.help) | `\((.metrics[0]?.labels? | try (keys | join(", ")) catch ""))` | \(.type) |"' -r
```
